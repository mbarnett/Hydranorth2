This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Deployment instructions

* ...

## Running the Tests

Setup dependencies and run the test suite:

   ```sh
   $ bundle install
   $ rake db:migrate
   ```

You may also want to run the Fedora and Solr servers in one window with:

   ```sh
   $ rake hydra:test_server
   ```

And run the test suite in another window:

   ```sh
   $ rake spec
   ```
